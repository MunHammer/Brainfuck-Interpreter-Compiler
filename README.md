# This is Brainfuck Interpreter + Compiler
Since I made the compiler a class, you could make it compile to your own language as well!

###### To run:
1. Make sure you have python installed
2. run Brainfuck.py with some arguements detailed below
3. Input a character whenever there's an underscore

###### Arguments:
1. if it will be compiling/interpreting to brainfuck or vice versa
   (type in bf, because I haven't done the other thing yet)
    1. If it will be compiling or interpreting (for interpreting, if you leave all other arguments blank, it'll be a REPL)
    1. The file it reads, or a small program to run/interpret
    2. The file it outputs it's results to, (if you leave this blank, it'll just print it out)
